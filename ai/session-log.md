# Session Log

This log records durable session milestones and active handoff notes. Keep detailed release history in `CHANGELOG.md`, implementation state in `ai/current-state.md`, active questions in `ai/open-threads.md`, and executable next work in `ai/tasks/next-actions.md`.

## 2026-05-07 - AI Continuity And Rename Foundation

- Added repo-native AI continuity under `ai/`, root `AGENTS.md`, session start/close prompts, and ADR-0001.
- Clarified continuity ownership: `AGENTS.md`, `ai/`, and `docs/decisions/` are Codex-managed; `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `PROJECT_NOTES.md` remain regular project docs.
- Standardized product/site naming as `Math Muscle Trainer`, renamed browser storage namespaces to `math-muscle-trainer-*` with legacy fallback reads, bumped the app to `v0.12.0`, and prepared `docs/v9`.
- Added `ai/task-map.md` and expanded session-close protocol so future sessions explicitly report docs updates, push status, and live verification status.
- Published and verified the rename/continuity batch on GitHub Pages.

## 2026-05-08 - Lesson Expansion And Content Workflow

- Added reusable addition lessons for Make 10, adding by 1s/10s/100s/1000s, Counting On Easy/Medium, and Bridging Easy/Medium/Advanced/Expert.
- Added addition completion tracking with `addition:<lesson-id>` keys and focused workout handoffs.
- Added table-specific multiplication lessons for `x1` through `x12`.
- Unlocked addition and multiplication lesson stage pills so learners can inspect any section.
- Recorded ADR-0003 for the reusable addition lesson loop and ADR-0004 for unlocked lesson sections.
- Initialized `learn/` teacher-authored content workflow and recorded ADR-0005.
- Published the lesson expansion as `v0.13.0` in `docs/v10`; repo checks passed and GitHub Pages was verified live.

## 2026-05-09 - Product Direction And Mastery Branch

- Clarified product direction: finish lesson content first, then lesson progression, four-operation mastery visibility, and onboarding/new-user flow.
- Confirmed iPad-first and eventual Apple App Store direction.
- Confirmed gamification is not the core goal; retention should come from skill-building, habit formation, visible growth, and mastery.
- Confirmed the app should stay usable from primary students through adults with a universal arithmetic-strength/mastery identity.
- Started `feature/learning-telemetry-mastery`.
- Added capped browser-local answer telemetry and the first Operation Mastery Progress slide.
- Implemented the rank chain `Rookie -> Novice -> Adept -> Expert -> Elite -> Master -> Legend`.
- Bumped root app to `v0.14.0`, generated `docs/v11`, and recorded ADR-0006.

## 2026-05-10 - Operation Mastery And Hybrid UI Pass

- Added `operationBestRanks` so current rank can move up/down while best-earned rank only rises.
- Reworked Operation Mastery from dense all-in-one cards to overview/detail, then to a single selector cycle: `Overview -> Addition -> Subtraction -> Multiplication -> Division`.
- Polished Progress layouts for iPad/tablet widths and hardened dynamic Progress markup by escaping labels before insertion.
- Executed a hybrid UI consistency pass: Learn placeholders, practice micro-feedback rail, light-mode fixes, Progress spacing, selector fit, and bottom-nav color consistency.
- Published the hybrid pass as `v0.15.0` in `docs/v12`; repo checks passed after snapshot publish.

## 2026-05-11 - App-Shell Contract And v0.16.0 Release

- User pushed for a more app-native, iPad-oriented visual direction rather than web-style stacked CTAs and nested panels.
- Established the shared app-shell UI contract in ADR-0007:
  - top-right global utility rail is Home/settings only,
  - carousel/kicker rows use fixed label tracks,
  - content headers own local selectors/actions,
  - static metrics do not hover/lift,
  - actionable tiles keep interactive affordances,
  - avoid large nested website-style section cards.
- Applied the UI system batch across Home, Results, Progress, Learn, and multiplication Practice More.
- Made Practice More auto-advance after correct answers and aligned its copy/feedback with the speed-first practice direction.
- Published, merged, pushed, and verified `v0.16.0` in `docs/v13`; repo checks and root JS syntax checks passed.

## 2026-05-11 - v0.17.0 App Viewport Frame

- User confirmed the app end-goal makes a preserved app viewport frame appropriate.
- Changed desktop/tablet-landscape rendering so `.page-shell` fits a centered `1194 x 834` iPad-landscape canvas rather than stretching to arbitrary desktop browser dimensions.
- Kept narrow/mobile behavior scroll-friendly below `700px`.
- Updated ADR-0007, bumped the app to `v0.17.0`, published `docs/v14`, pushed `main`, and verified GitHub Pages live.
- Checks passed: `scripts/check-repo.ps1` and `node --check` on all root JS modules.

## 2026-05-11 - Active UI Intake For Next Batch

- Practice screen still has an obvious large "box within the shell"; remove or soften the container while preserving HUD, progress bar, problem card, input, and keypad as functional units.
- `Exit Lesson` is local to lesson mode and should move out of the global utility rail into the lesson header/content area.
- Progress and Results kicker/header spacing still need a joint pass so labels are centered in their reserved tracks and headers get enough breathing room.
- Workout Tracker summary stats still look highlightable; remove hover/highlight affordances from display-only metrics.
- Home menu was tactically centered with `Learn`, `Start Workout`, and `Progress`; fuller Home composition remains deferred.

## 2026-05-12 - Project Memory And Roadmap Pruning

- User chose backlog/roadmap cleanup as the best use of available Codex time.
- Reworked `PROJECT_NOTES.md` into durable project memory with current snapshot, design direction, decisions, idea bank, adaptive learning ideas, and short recent-session memory.
- Reorganized `ai/open-threads.md` into decision categories.
- Reorganized `ai/tasks/next-actions.md` into concrete groups.
- Compressed `ai/session-log.md` into milestone entries plus active handoff notes to reduce duplicate history already covered by `CHANGELOG.md`, ADRs, and `ai/current-state.md`.
- Added roadmap/process attention for reviewing the AI continuity infrastructure and deciding an explicit versioning policy.
- Added toggle ideas to the backlog and recorded that adaptive learning should not be a simple user-facing on/off setting.
- Captured the design target as minimalist, friendly native iPad controls for all ages: clear and low-clutter without becoming cold, boxy, or childish.
- Created `docs/design/ui-direction.md` as the stable design direction document and linked it from `ai/task-map.md` and ADR-0007.
- Created `docs/design/component-system.md` as the reusable role/class contract so future UI work can share one button/control/content system while visual exploration continues.
- Implemented the first CSS alignment pass for shared controls: softer tactile buttons, toggles, selectors, metrics, lesson cards, and fact/action cards using the existing theme/color system.
- Captured the need for small visual anchors/icons/math-strength marks so the app evolves from mostly text-based surfaces into a more interactive native-app feel.
- Applied the first visual-anchor implementation to Home, Setup, and Practice: Home destination marks, operation symbols, workout-type cues, and Practice status/HUD icons.
- Added `docs/design/current-button-ui.md` to document the current implemented button/control baseline for screenshot comparison.
- Clarified that the visual upgrade should not mean putting icons inside every button; future visual richness should live more at the app/screen/card/lesson/progress/status level.
- Added a compact centered rounded training dock for `Train`, `Learn`, and `Progress`.
- Changed app startup to open directly to the Train/setup surface instead of the launcher-style Home surface.
- Removed decorative visual anchors from Home destination buttons and Setup workout-type choices; operation symbols and Practice status/HUD cues remain where they carry direct math/status meaning.
- Ran `node --check` on all root JS modules; syntax checks passed.
- Ran a CSS brace sanity check; braces are balanced.
- Reran `scripts/check-repo.ps1`; expected snapshot-drift failures remain because root `index.html`, `styles.css`, `js/app-core.js`, `js/app-init.js`, and `js/app-practice.js` now differ from latest `docs/v14`.

## 2026-05-13 - v0.18.0 GitHub Sync

- Bumped the runtime app version to `v0.18.0`.
- Moved the UI direction changelog notes into the `0.18.0` release heading.
- Published `docs/v15` from the root app and updated `docs/index.html` to mark it latest.
- Ran `scripts/check-repo.ps1`; result: `All repo checks passed.`
- Ran `node --check` on all root JS modules; syntax checks passed.
