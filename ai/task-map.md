# AI Task Map

Use this map to route future Codex/GPT sessions to the right files before editing.

## App Structure / Startup

1. Relevant source files
   - `index.html` - screen markup, controls, dialogs, script order.
   - `js/app-init.js` - display version resolution, startup rendering, event binding.
   - `js/app-core.js` - shared constants, state defaults, setup helpers.
   - `js/app-techniques.js` - app view routing via `requestView` and `showView`.
   - `js/app-debug.js` - opt-in teacher/developer debug mode and persona seeding.
2. Related docs or ADRs
   - `README.md`
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `ai/context.md`
   - `docs/decisions/ADR-0001-ai-continuity-system.md`
3. Read before editing
   - `AGENTS.md`, `ai/context.md`, `ai/current-state.md`
   - The script tags near the end of `index.html`
   - `initialise()` in `js/app-init.js`
   - Debug activation in `js/app-debug.js` if changing startup, routing, storage, or test personas.
4. Common risks or things not to break
   - Script order matters because modules share globals.
   - Duplicate element IDs break bindings and `scripts/check-repo.ps1`.
   - View buttons depend on matching `data-view-target` values and screen IDs.
   - The app should still open directly from `index.html`.
   - Debug mode is a client-side classroom gate only; do not add secrets or real admin behavior to it.

## Workout Logic

1. Relevant source files
   - `js/app-practice.js` - session lifecycle, timers, answer handling, completion.
   - `js/app-core.js` - setup reading, settings snapshots, defaults, labels.
   - `js/app-progress.js` - tracker-card workout entry points.
   - `js/app-techniques.js` - Learn-to-workout handoff actions.
   - `index.html` - setup controls, practice form, end-workout dialog.
2. Related docs or ADRs
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `PROJECT_NOTES.md`
   - `ai/current-state.md`
3. Read before editing
   - `readSettings()`, `applySettingsSnapshot()`, and `sanitiseSettingsSnapshot()` in `js/app-core.js`
   - `startSession()`, `beginPracticeSession()`, `registerAnswer()`, and `completeSession()` in `js/app-practice.js`
   - Tracker training helpers in `js/app-progress.js` if the entry point starts from Progress.
4. Common risks or things not to break
   - Do not bypass `applySettingsSnapshot()` for focused workouts.
   - Keep countdown, HUD timers, Spar strikes, and completion paths in sync.
   - Completed workouts must update progress, records, calendars, streaks, and results.
   - Manual exits should still use the in-app confirmation dialog.

## Question Generation

1. Relevant source files
   - `js/app-practice.js` - `buildMultiplicationPool()`, `buildAdditionPool()`, `buildSubtractionPool()`, `buildDivisionPool()`, `buildPool()`, `pickQuestion()`.
   - `js/app-core.js` - operation options, display/storage symbols, settings normalization.
   - `js/app-progress.js` - fact and bucket parsing used by progress views.
2. Related docs or ADRs
   - `README.md`
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `PROJECT_NOTES.md`
3. Read before editing
   - `OPERATION_OPTIONS`, `OPERATION_SYMBOLS`, and `OPERATION_STORAGE_SYMBOLS` in `js/app-core.js`
   - The relevant `build*Pool()` function and `evaluateFactAnswer()` in `js/app-practice.js`
   - Bucket helpers in `js/app-progress.js` if new facts affect analytics.
4. Common risks or things not to break
   - Fact keys should stay stable so old progress remains readable.
   - Division stores `/` in keys and displays `\u00f7` in UI.
   - Addition and multiplication are commutative; subtraction and division are not.
   - Isolation ranges should generate varied facts, not a single repeated fact.

## Learn / Techniques Mode

1. Relevant source files
   - `js/app-techniques.js` - Learn menu, multiplication lessons, addition lessons, routing, dialogs.
   - `js/app-core.js` - technique state defaults and technique question helpers.
   - `index.html` - Learn screen shell and lesson exit dialog.
   - `styles.css` - lesson, keypad, stage, and full-screen Learn styling.
2. Related docs or ADRs
   - `PROJECT_NOTES.md`
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `ai/current-state.md`
3. Read before editing
   - `renderTechniqueScreen()` and `handleTechniqueAction()` in `js/app-techniques.js`
   - Multiplication helpers around `getMultiplicationLessonPlan()` and the `renderTechnique*Stage()` functions.

   - `createTechniqueState()` and related technique helpers in `js/app-core.js`
4. Common risks or things not to break
   - Leaving a lesson should preserve the intended modal behavior.
   - `Start Focused Workout` actions should route through setup snapshots.
   - Technique completion state is saved in browser progress.
   - Addition technique completion uses `addition:<lesson-id>` progress keys.
   - Lesson section pills are intentionally unlocked; do not reintroduce section locking unless a new assessment mode requires it.
   - Keyboard and touch keypad behavior should remain usable on tablets.

   - `getLocalStorageItemWithFallback()`, `loadProgress()`, `saveProgress()`, `loadTheme()`, `loadColorMode()`, and `loadKeypadPreference()`
   - All `normalise*` helpers touching stored objects.
4. Common risks or things not to break
