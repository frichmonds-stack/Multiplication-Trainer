# Math Muscle Trainer

A strength-themed arithmetic practice webapp built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What it does

- Uses a slimmer app-style shell with a separate header band and dedicated Setup, Practice, Results, and Progress screens
- Adds a Learn / Techniques mode with a full-screen `10x` lesson flow for learning a table trick before drilling it
- Supports operation-based training with Addition and Multiplication (Subtraction and Division are planned)
- Supports mixed-table multiplication practice or a focused single-table isolation mode
- Supports High Intensity Training, Target Reps, Zen Mode, and Spar Mode workout types
- Supports all workout modes for Addition except Isolation
- Supports addition difficulty presets (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`) for quick setup
- Supports positive and negative integer multiplication while keeping the practice range magnitude-based
- Keeps the practice screen minimal with a question timer, workout timer, countdown start, and quick right/wrong feedback
- Adds a touch-first number pad for iPad/tablet-friendly answering without disabling keyboard input
- Uses adaptive question weighting to bring back new or missed facts more often
- Tracks daily star and heart goals with browser-local workout history
- Shows a shared month-view workout tracker calendar across Results and Progress
- Uses carousel-style Results and Progress screens to reduce scrolling
- Supports swipe gestures and visible slide-position indicators on carousel screens
- Applies soft min/max carousel height bounds to reduce layout jumps across different slides
- Shows Positive Progress before weaker targets so the feedback loop starts with wins
- Shows operation-aware fact tracking:
  - multiplication table tracker
  - addition bucket tracker with overall, regrouping, and non-regrouping stats
- Includes personal bests, recent workouts, and daily record stats like most attempts in a day
- Uses a custom in-app end-workout modal instead of the browser confirm popup
- Uses a matching in-app lesson exit modal for leaving a technique mid-way
- Saves completed table lessons in the browser so finished techniques can be shown on the menu
- Uses operation selection in Learn / Techniques to load operation-specific lessons
- Uses staged Learn progress pills with explicit unlocked/current/locked states
- Keeps a rolling recent-progress window for dated history data to keep storage lean
- Saves long-term progress in the browser with localStorage
- Supports independent palette and dark/light mode appearance controls with rotating strength-building banner messages
