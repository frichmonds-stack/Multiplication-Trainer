# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is inspired by Keep a Changelog and uses a simple project-friendly version history.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Added navigation-aware end-workout confirmation copy so leaving an active workout can route directly to `My Progress` or `Learn Techniques` after save.
- Added click/keyboard flip interactions for addition tracker cards so summary and recent-example views can be toggled in place.
- Added helper text under the daily rewards strip clarifying goal semantics: `Heart = 10 attempts` and `Star = 10 correct`.

### Changed
- Updated Learn `10x` assisted reps, solo reps, and practice stage layouts to use a shared practice-style question shell for visual consistency.
- Extended technique answer colour splitting to support factor-aware overlays for full-answer fields so entries like `40` and `100` render with clearer factor/zero separation.
- Improved question selection to avoid immediate fact repeats when alternative questions exist.
- Refined practice feedback copy to include explicit correct-answer guidance on misses/skips.
- Updated active workout navigation UX to use a confirm-before-leave workflow rather than disabling top-level navigation controls.
- Repositioned carousel indicators to top-centre and increased arrow prominence/size while pushing nav buttons further outside the carousel frame.
- Increased Options form spacing around stacked fields (including `Color Mode`) and improved touch ergonomics for answer entry/keypad controls.
- Enhanced focus/records information hierarchy to reduce same-weight text walls and better emphasize key metrics.
- Expanded light-mode contrast handling across workout/session chips, streak visuals, calendar cells, and technique completion/locked states.
- Bumped in-app version from `v0.8.0` to `v0.9.0`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Added app-wide `Dark` / `Light` mode in Options (separate from color palette selection).
- Added touch swipe navigation for Results and Progress carousels.
- Added top-center carousel position indicators (`current / total` + dots) for Results and Progress.

### Changed
- Fixed multiplication fact-tracker table status chips so attempt-driven status labels render correctly.
- Switched question selection to use a session-stable question pool (rebuilt at workout start instead of every prompt).
- Added rolling-window pruning for dated progress stores (`dailyRecords`, `bucketDaily`, `workoutHistory`) to keep browser storage bounded.
- Added capped addition example memory by bucket (5 recent examples per bucket) and surfaced recent examples directly on addition tracker cards.
- Split monolithic runtime logic from `app.js` into focused files under `js/` (`app-core`, `app-techniques`, `app-practice`, `app-progress`, `app-init`) to reduce maintenance drag before feature expansion.
- Updated skip semantics so skipping no longer advances question-goal completion, while still counting as a missed fact signal for tracker difficulty stats.
- Added fact-progress compaction caps (per operation + global) with retention based on recency and difficulty signals to keep `facts` storage bounded.
- Renamed session/progress internals toward `answered` semantics while retaining legacy `attempted` mirrors for backward compatibility.
- Reworked Setup operation cards so selected operation exposes a `Change` reset action (no confirmation) and cleanly returns setup to the starting state.
- Removed forced keypad lockout so keyboard input remains available even when number pad is visible.
- Replaced keypad minus entry with a sign-toggle control to reduce delete/retype friction.
- Removed duplicate submit pathway in keypad mode by dropping the extra keypad `Enter` row.
- Tightened practice vertical spacing (HUD, problem area, keypad, and feedback) for better tablet fit.
- Restyled floating carousel arrows with stronger contrast and moved them to overlap frame boundaries for clearer affordance.
- Added soft carousel height governance with bounded min/max behavior (no hard fixed height).
- Upgraded Learn stage pills to explicit states (`current`, `unlocked`, `locked`) with lock icon treatment for inaccessible steps.
- Added stage-pill click navigation for unlocked Learn steps.
- Added color-coded technique input rendering so typed answers visually match factor/zero example color language.
- Improved Frozen palette contrast where factor and zero highlight colors were colliding.
- Widened Options dialog and added internal scroll containment for longer settings/update content.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- App appearance palettes in Options with five selectable themes: `Original`, `Sunny Beach Day`, `Jungle`, `Frozen`, and `Aang`.
- Number-pad preference control in Options with `Auto`, `Always On`, and `Always Off`.
- Fact Tracker secondary selector:
  - Addition: `Overall`, `With regrouping`, `Without regrouping`
  - Multiplication: `Overall`, `Positive Integers`, `All Integers`

### Changed
- Setup now starts in split layout and keeps the right panel visible from the beginning.
- Removed setup backtrack buttons and moved backtracking to inline editing of earlier choices.
- Setup settings panel now unlocks after workout type selection, with a guided waiting message beforehand.
- Addition fact tracker cards now use the same static card style as multiplication cards (selector-driven detail view instead of tap-flip).
- Migrated accent-hardcoded UI reds to theme-aware accent tokens so palette changes apply consistently across the app shell.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Reworked Setup into a progressive flow: choose operation first, then (for addition) difficulty, then workout type before advanced options appear.
- Added setup backtracking controls so operation and workout type can be changed without leaving the screen.
- Stopped persisting setup choices between workouts so each new workout begins from a fresh setup state.
- Moved addition difficulty ahead of workout type selection to better match the decision flow.

- Boosted streak feedback with stronger tier visuals and a visible in-workout combo counter.
- Updated Techniques menu layout with the operation selector in the header, streamlined intro copy, and removed redundant prompt/callout text.
- Updated Fact Tracker title copy to operation-aware wording: `Track the development of your {operation} skills.`

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- Per-slide operation filters for Workout Log, Next Focus, and Coach Notes so filtering is contextual instead of globally persistent.
- Bucket-level trend cards for Positive Progress and Growth Opportunities (multiplication tables + addition buckets) using rolling 7-day comparisons.
- Addition tracker tap-to-reveal cards with a front summary and back regrouping split.
- New staged addition lesson cards:
  - Adding by 1s
  - Adding by 10s
  - Adding by 100s
  - Adding by 1000s

### Changed
- Updated Workout Records controls so operation + workout-type filters sit together in the top-right heading.
- Refined addition bucket labels to explicit digit language (for example `1-digit + 2-digit`).
- Changed lesson availability messaging so `Make 10` is `Under Construction` (selectable) and remaining addition lessons are `Coming Soon`.
- Improved calendar readability and touch ergonomics with stronger weekday/day contrast and larger month-nav targets.
- Rebalanced tracker column spacing and compact stat sizing for iPad presentation.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-24

- Addition workout support for High Intensity Training, Target Reps, Zen Mode, and Spar Mode (Isolation intentionally excluded for this release).
- Addition difficulty presets (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`) with equal-weighted category sampling.
- iPad-friendly on-screen number pad with Enter support to reduce virtual keyboard intrusion during practice.
- Operation-aware filters in My Progress (`All`, `Multiplication`, `Addition`) that drive overview, focus, and coach views.

  - Triple + Single
  - Triple + Double
  - Triple + Triple
- Addition bucket analytics split into overall, with regrouping, and without regrouping.
- Workout Records dual-filtering by operation and workout type, with operation-conditional mode options.
- Technique menu operation selector that loads multiplication or addition lesson sets.

### Changed
- Replaced the Setup workout preview panel with a two-column operation + settings layout.
- Added streak intensity visuals (`smoke`, `spark`, `flame`) around the progress bar and practice area.
- Updated browser storage keys for this release (`v2`) to simplify migration while operations are expanding.
- Updated options modal update notes to reflect the operation-layer release.

### Notes
- Rewards mechanic was intentionally left unchanged in this pass.
- User testing note captured: rewards icon meaning (heart/star) needs a dedicated clarity pass.
- User testing note captured: multiplication negatives randomization needs rebalancing across sign combinations in a future update.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Keyboard shortcuts for Results and Progress carousels (`Left`/`Right` arrows) plus `Escape` handling to close open dialogs and quickly exit an in-progress lesson.

### Changed
- Added stronger accessibility semantics for hidden/active screens and carousel slides, plus active nav `aria-current` state updates.

- Made pattern blanks semi-random with auto-checking feedback, including occasional blank `10` factors.
- Changed assisted reps to auto-advance after correct answers instead of requiring a separate next button.
- Preserved typed lesson answers when opening hints, while still clearing wrong solo-rep answers as intended.
- Made extra post-lesson practice voluntary instead of an automatic final stage.
- Disabled carousel arrows at the ends, strengthened their floating treatment, and anchored them more consistently so they stop shifting with panel height.
- Rebalanced the header with a larger hero/title presence, a wider workout tracker card, a more elongated cog button, and a unified Learn Techniques nav treatment.
- Updated the hero tagline to `Grow your brain & begin your reign.`
