- Added a compact rounded training dock for primary app navigation and made Train the default entry surface.
- Reduced decorative icons inside destination/workout buttons so visuals can move toward app-level, lesson-level, progress/status, and math-context cues instead of cluttering every control.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- Changed the desktop/tablet-landscape app shell to preserve a fitted `1194 x 834` iPad-landscape canvas instead of stretching to arbitrary browser window shapes.

- Added lightweight PowerShell repo checks for duplicate IDs, missing script files, version drift, stale release labels, docs sync, and removed-helper regressions.
- Added a snapshot publishing helper to copy the current app into a new `docs/v*` folder and keep the docs index's latest marker singular.

- Fixed stale docs version index copy that marked both v6 and v7 as latest.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Added a dedicated `Home` view as the default entry frame with quick-action cards for `Work Out`, `Learn`, and `My Progress`.

- Added helper text under the daily rewards strip clarifying goal semantics: `Heart = 10 attempts` and `Star = 10 correct`.

### Changed
- Updated Learn `10x` assisted reps, solo reps, and practice stage layouts to use a shared practice-style question shell for visual consistency.

- Improved question selection to avoid immediate fact repeats when alternative questions exist.
- Refined practice feedback copy to include explicit correct-answer guidance on misses/skips.
- Updated active workout navigation UX to use a confirm-before-leave workflow rather than disabling top-level navigation controls.
- Repositioned carousel indicators to top-centre and increased arrow prominence/size while pushing nav buttons further outside the carousel frame.
- Increased Options form spacing around stacked fields (including `Color Mode`) and improved touch ergonomics for answer entry/keypad controls.

- Added capped addition example memory by bucket (5 recent examples per bucket) and surfaced recent examples directly on addition tracker cards.
- Split monolithic runtime logic from `app.js` into focused files under `js/` (`app-core`, `app-techniques`, `app-practice`, `app-progress`, `app-init`) to reduce maintenance drag before feature expansion.
- Updated skip semantics so skipping no longer advances question-goal completion, while still counting as a missed fact signal for tracker difficulty stats.
- Added fact-progress compaction caps (per operation + global) with retention based on recency and difficulty signals to keep `facts` storage bounded.
- Renamed session/progress internals toward `answered` semantics while retaining legacy `attempted` mirrors for backward compatibility.
- Reworked Setup operation cards so selected operation exposes a `Change` reset action (no confirmation) and cleanly returns setup to the starting state.
- Removed forced keypad lockout so keyboard input remains available even when number pad is visible.
- Replaced keypad minus entry with a sign-toggle control to reduce delete/retype friction.
- Removed duplicate submit pathway in keypad mode by dropping the extra keypad `Enter` row.
- Tightened practice vertical spacing (HUD, problem area, keypad, and feedback) for better tablet fit.

- Removed setup backtrack buttons and moved backtracking to inline editing of earlier choices.
- Setup settings panel now unlocks after workout type selection, with a guided waiting message beforehand.
- Addition fact tracker cards now use the same static card style as multiplication cards (selector-driven detail view instead of tap-flip).
- Migrated accent-hardcoded UI reds to theme-aware accent tokens so palette changes apply consistently across the app shell.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Reworked Setup into a progressive flow: choose operation first, then (for addition) difficulty, then workout type before advanced options appear.

- New staged addition lesson cards:

### Changed
- Updated Workout Records controls so operation + workout-type filters sit together in the top-right heading.
- Refined addition bucket labels to explicit digit language (for example `1-digit + 2-digit`).

- User testing note captured: multiplication negatives randomization needs rebalancing across sign combinations in a future update.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Keyboard shortcuts for Results and Progress carousels (`Left`/`Right` arrows) plus `Escape` handling to close open dialogs and quickly exit an in-progress lesson.

- Preserved typed lesson answers when opening hints, while still clearing wrong solo-rep answers as intended.
