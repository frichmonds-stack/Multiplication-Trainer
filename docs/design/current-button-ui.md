# Current Button UI Reference

Last updated: 2026-05-12

This document describes the current implemented button/control direction after the early UI direction batches. Use it when comparing screenshots against the intended style.

It is not the final design system. It is the current working baseline.

## Design Formula

Current target:

`Concept 3 tactile softness + Concept 1 hierarchy and spacing discipline`

In practice this means:

- softer controls than the original boxy design-system concepts,
- clearer layout hierarchy than the more playful concept directions,
- native iPad feel,
- minimalist and low-clutter,
- friendly enough for young learners,
- polished enough for adults,
- strength/math identity without heavy decoration.

## Implemented Visual Language

The current UI uses:

- rounded pill buttons for global utilities and most text buttons,
- a compact centered rounded training dock for primary app navigation,
- soft dark surfaces with subtle highlight gradients,
- warm red/coral primary actions from the existing theme tokens,
- restrained buttons with fewer decorative icons inside them,
- visual anchors/icons used more selectively for app context, operation identity, and status scanability,
- softer card radii on action tiles and metrics,
- switch-style toggles for binary setup options,
- compact rounded icon utilities for Home/settings and carousel-style controls.

The current implementation deliberately keeps the existing theme/color system:

- `--accent`, `--accent-strong`, and `--accent-rgb` still drive primary color.
- Theme variants still override those tokens.
- Light mode receives separate overrides where needed.

## Button Roles

### Primary

Current classes:

- `.primary-button`
- `.nav-button-primary`
- `.home-start-button`

Intended look:

- solid warm red/coral,
- tactile highlight,
- stronger shadow than secondary/ghost,
- obvious main next action,
- not neon,
- usually one per screen or local panel.

Current examples:

- Setup `Start`
- Practice `Check`
- Confirmation dialog confirm buttons

Compare screenshots for:

- Does the primary action clearly stand out?
- Does it feel strong but not aggressive?
- Is there only one dominant action in the area?

### Secondary / Action Tile

Current classes:

- `.nav-button`
- `.home-menu-row .nav-button`
- `.choice-pill`
- `.operation-choice`
- `.technique-card`
- `.table-card[role="button"]`

Intended look:

- dark tactile surface,
- softer than a rectangle,
- clear label plus optional visual anchor,
- interactive but not as loud as primary,
- strong enough to feel tappable.

Current examples:

- Setup operation choices
- Setup workout type choices
- Lesson cards
- Fact tracker cards

Compare screenshots for:

- Does it look tappable?
- Does it avoid competing with the primary button?
- Does any visual anchor help scanning rather than decorating the button?
- Does the card feel too empty or too boxed?

### Training Dock

Current classes:

- `.app-dock`
- `.app-dock-button`

Intended look:

- compact rounded taskbar/dock,
- centered near the bottom of the iPad app canvas,
- text-first labels,
- selected destination filled with the warm red/coral accent,
- inactive destinations quiet and legible,
- not stretched across the full landscape width.

Current examples:

- `Train`
- `Learn`
- `Progress`

Compare screenshots for:

- Does the dock feel like native app chrome rather than a website nav bar?
- Does it hug its contents instead of becoming a wide empty banner?
- Is the active destination clear?
- Are labels readable for young learners?
- Does it stay calm enough for adults?

### Ghost

Current classes:

- `.ghost-button`
- `.subtle-button`

Intended look:

- quiet,
- lower emphasis,
- useful for exit/cancel/back/skip,
- still touchable,
- not a full primary-style box.

Current examples:

- `End Workout`
- `Skip`
- Home icon button when implemented as a ghost button in focused screens
- Cancel buttons in dialogs

Compare screenshots for:

- Does it stay quiet?
- Is it still discoverable?
- Does it avoid looking like the main action?

### Icon Utility

Current classes:

- `.utility-button`
- `.carousel-button`
- `.calendar-nav-button`
- `.carousel-inline-nav-button`
- `.fact-range-button`
- selected small local icon buttons

Intended look:

- compact rounded touch targets,
- icon-first,
- app utility feel,
- used for Home/settings/arrows/help/close.

Current examples:

- top-right settings button,
- top-right Home button on focused screens,
- carousel arrows,
- fact-range arrows.

Compare screenshots for:

- Does it feel like app chrome rather than content?
- Is it compact but still easy to tap?
- Are local controls kept out of the global rail?

## Visual Anchors

Current classes:

- `.visual-anchor`
- `.operation-choice-icon`
- `.session-badge-icon`
- `.hud-icon`

Current examples:

- Setup operations: `+`, `-`, `x`, division
- Practice status/HUD icons

Intended look:

- small contained marks,
- consistent rounded mini surface,
- useful for scanning,
- not decorative clutter,
- labels remain present for young learners.

Current rule:

- Do not add icons to every button just to make the app feel visual.
- Prefer screen-level, card-level, lesson-level, progress/status, and brand/operation visuals.
- Text-first buttons are preferred unless the icon is the action or the symbol carries direct math meaning.

Compare screenshots for:

- Does the visual anchor make the area easier to understand?
- Does it feel integrated with the text?
- Is it too small, too detached, or floating?
- Is the icon style consistent?

## Toggles

Current classes:

- `.toggle`
- `.toggle-row`
- `.toggle-label`

Current behavior:

- native checkbox inputs are restyled as switch-like toggles.
- on state uses the current accent theme.
- off state uses a dark neutral track.

Current examples:

- `Targeted`
- `Negatives`
- `Regrouping`

Compare screenshots for:

- Does the switch read as on/off?
- Is the label close enough to the control?
- Does the active state fit the current theme?
- Is the switch too visually heavy in Setup?

## Current Screen Read

### Home

Current status: retained as a brand/home surface, but no longer the default entry screen.

Working:

- clear primary/secondary hierarchy,
- app-like utility buttons,
- brand mark gives the screen a visual identity.

Watch:

- the home destination modules are now secondary to the dock and may eventually be reduced further,
- long-term logo/icon mark should combine math and strength more clearly.

### Setup

Current status: default entry screen and main Train surface.

Working:

- rounded training dock makes Setup feel like a primary app destination,
- operation chip/choice benefits from math symbols,
- difficulty buttons feel closer to the button system,
- top utilities are consistent.

Watch:

- workout type cards are cleaner without decorative internal icons, but still need manual review for spacing and scale,
- selected and unselected states need careful visual review.

Likely next refinement:

- tune workout type cards so they feel like compact setup choices rather than empty panels.
- add richer visual identity elsewhere in the app, especially lessons/progress/status, instead of decorating those buttons.

### Practice

Current status: first pass applied, needs manual review.

Working:

- status/HUD icons reduce text-only feel,
- shared button/toggle styling carries through.

Watch:

- Practice still needs the larger app-shell pass that removes/softens any remaining "box inside shell" feeling,
- keypad buttons should stay large and highly legible,
- HUD icons should not make the top area feel busy.

## Consistency Checklist

Use this when reviewing a screenshot:

- Does the rounded dock look centered, compact, and purpose-built?
- Is the main action red/coral and visually dominant?
- Are secondary/action tiles dark, tactile, and softer than hard rectangles?
- Are ghost buttons quiet?
- Are icon utilities compact and in the right place?
- Are visual anchors used selectively rather than stuffed into every control?
- Do labels remain clear for young learners?
- Does the screen avoid feeling like a website or corporate dashboard?
- Does the screen avoid feeling like a toy or arcade game?
- Does the screen still feel minimalist?
- Does light mode preserve the same role hierarchy?

## Known Gaps

- The current classes are still historical (`primary-button`, `ghost-button`, `nav-button`) rather than the cleaner future contract (`.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.action-tile`, etc.).
- Setup workout type cards need another visual pass after the icon cleanup.
- Progress and Learn have not fully received the visual-anchor/component-system treatment yet.
- No visual reference screenshots are stored in the repo yet.
- The latest docs snapshot has not been republished after root UI changes.
